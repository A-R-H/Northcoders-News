# Northcoders News

This project is available hosted on Heroku at https://alex-nc-news.herokuapp.com/.

This was the result of a 3 day sprint project to create a news article aggregator site (in the style of Reddit) using React that used a specific set of api endpoints from an Express server that had been previously created and deployed on Heroku. The repository of the back-end is available at https://github.com/A-R-H/Northcoders-News-Back-End.

The main aim of the project was to increase my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front-end perspective and to gain experience of building and linking the front and back-end of the same app.
